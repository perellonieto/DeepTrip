# DeepTrip

Code based on Google Deepdream to visualize all the hidden layers.

The code is basically the [google/deepdream](https://github.com/google/deepdream) without the Ipython/Notebook
parts and other parts from [DeepDreamVideo](https://github.com/graphific/DeepDreamVideo)

See an frame example per each layer in [my research assistant webpage](https://users.ics.aalto.fi/perellm1/deep_dreams.shtml)
